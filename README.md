## SQM Meter using ESP32, TSL2591 and MQTT

Simple SQM meter that sends SQM values to a MQTT broker using an ESP32 and ESPHome

I remixed the case from here to cover up the holes and make it a bit better at not letting rain inside the housing. I sealed any opening and the seam between the lid and the main cover body with hot glue.:

**Wiring**

Use Adafruit's documentation to wire up the sensor. I used the Adafruit Stemma 4-pin connectors and cables so wiring was a breeze.
