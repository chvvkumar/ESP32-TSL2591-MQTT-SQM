## SQM Meter using ESP32, TSL2591 and MQTT

Simple SQM meter that sends SQM values to a MQTT broker using an ESP32. I have included ArduinoOTA for remote firmware updates as once sealed and mounted outside, it would be hard to take the meter down for updates using a cable.

I remixed the case from here to cover up the holes and make it a bit better at not letting rain inside the housing. I sealed any opening and the seam between the lid and the main cover body with hot glue.:

**Wiring**

Use Adafruit's documentation to wire up the sensor. I used the Adafruit Stemma 4-pin connectors and cables so wiring was a breeze.

**Libraries**

Libraries should be installed first and these can be found by searching the library installer in Arduino IDE for the headers at the top of the main program.

**Secrets**

Secrets are stored in the `arduino_secrets.h` file, customize it to your needs.
